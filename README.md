Redirection Checker Python
==========================

This is a Python script that checks if a list of urls is being redirected to a list of specific list of urls. It takes a CSV file with two columns as an input.

## Requirements
- Python 2.7

## Usage
On Linux/Mac run with:
```
python redirection-checker.py
```
On Windows just double click **redirection-checker.py** .
It will ask you to input a CSV from which it will read the URLs to check and the URLs to compare with.

You can also run the script on Linux/Mac with:
```
python redirection-checker.py sample.csv
```
And on Windows, by dragging and dropping **sample.csv** over **redirection-checker.py** . 



Check the file **sample.csv** to see the structure of the input files should have. 
Some errors were intentionally added to **sample.csv** .
